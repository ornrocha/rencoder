# rencoder
Rencoder is a software package developed in Java language to be used as a friendly front-end for the FFmpeg. 
This tool can be used on  Windows or Linux, but the FFmpeg binary distribution must be suitable for the operating system. 
Several features present in FFmpeg can be easily used to convert a wide range of media formats, using the common encoders and HWAccel encoders.
